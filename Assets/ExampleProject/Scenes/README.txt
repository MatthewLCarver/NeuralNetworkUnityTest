Please ensure that you run the Training scene first.

   For testing, open the NewData scriptable object and set the File Name to TrainedModel.
 
   While the training simulation is running, click the Load Training Data button and a fully trained data set will be loaded into the Neural Network.

   From there feel free to open up the RacingScene and race against the trained model. 

WASD are the controls for your car.
